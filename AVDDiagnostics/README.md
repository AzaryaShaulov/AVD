# AVD Diagnostics Configuration Tool

A PowerShell script to automatically configure Azure Monitor diagnostic settings for Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) resources.

## Overview

This tool discovers AVD resources in your Azure subscription and configures diagnostic settings to send logs and metrics to a Log Analytics workspace. It enforces the use of `allLogs` category group wherever supported for comprehensive logging.

## Purpose

Azure Virtual Desktop generates diagnostic logs that are **critical for monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining a healthy AVD environment**. However, diagnostic settings are **not enabled by default** on AVD resources. This script automates the configuration process across all your AVD resources (Host Pools, Application Groups, and Workspaces), ensuring consistent logging coverage.

**Key Goals:**
- **Automate** diagnostic settings configuration across all AVD resources
- **Standardize** logging configuration using best practices (allLogs category)
- **Eliminate** manual configuration overhead and human error
- **Ensure** comprehensive visibility into your AVD environment

## What Are AVD Diagnostic Logs?

Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostic logs capture detailed telemetry about your AVD environment's operations, performance, and user activities. These logs are stored in Log Analytics workspaces where they can be queried, analyzed, and used for alerting.

### Critical Log Categories

**Host Pools:**
- `HostRegistration` - Session host registration events, health status changes
- `Connection` - User connection attempts, successes, and failures
- `Error` - Errors occurring at the host pool level
- `Checkpoint` - Lifecycle events and state transitions
- `Management` - Administrative operations and configuration changes
- `AgentHealthStatus` - AVD agent health monitoring

**Application Groups:**
- `Checkpoint` - Application group lifecycle events
- `Error` - Application-specific errors
- `Management` - Application group configuration changes

**Workspaces:**
- `Checkpoint` - Workspace lifecycle events
- `Error` - Workspace-level errors
- `Management` - Workspace configuration changes
- `Feed` - User feed subscription activities

### Real-World Use Cases

**Troubleshooting Connection Issues:**
```kusto
WVDConnections
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where State == "Failed"
| project TimeGenerated, UserName, ClientOS, ClientType, CorrelationId, Message
```

**Monitoring Agent Health:**
```kusto
WVDAgentHealthStatus
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where Status != "Available"
| summarize count() by SessionHostName, Status
```

**Tracking User Sessions:**
```kusto
WVDConnections
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where State == "Connected"
| summarize Sessions = count() by UserName, ClientOS
| order by Sessions desc
```

## Why Enable Diagnostic Logs? (Best Practices)

Enabling diagnostic logs for Azure Virtual Desktop is considered a **critical best practice** for the following reasons:

| Best Practice | Benefits |

1. **Login to Azure:**
   ```powershell
   az login
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```powershell
   .\AvdDiag-minimal.ps1 -SubscriptionId "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID"
   ```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SubscriptionId` | No | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` | Azure subscription ID |

## Usage Examples

### Check Current Status
Review diagnostic settings without making any changes:
```powershell
.\AvdDiag-minimal.ps1 -SubscriptionId "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID" -CheckOnly
```

### Configure with Custom Workspace
Apply diagnostic settings using a specific Log Analytics workspace:
```powershell
.\AvdDiag-minimal.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID" `
    -WorkspaceName "MyCustomLAW" `
    -WorkspaceResourceGroup "MyResourceGroup"
```

Use default workspace values:
```powershell
.\AvdDiag-minimal.ps1 -SubscriptionId "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID"
```

## Output

The script provides:

1. **Console Output:** Color-coded status messages for each resource
   - 🟢 Green: Success
   - 🟡 Yellow: Skipped or warnings
   - 🔴 Red: Errors

2. **CSV Report:** Detailed results exported to the specified CSV path
   - Resource name and type
   - Configuration status
   - Actions taken
   - Any errors encountered

3. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Total resources found
   - Successfully configured
   - Skipped (already configured)
   - Failed

## Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Enabled (allLogs)` | Configured with comprehensive logging |
| `Enabled (not allLogs)` | Configured but not using allLogs category |
| `Not Configured` | No diagnostic settings exist |
| `Disabled` | Diagnostic settings exist but are disabled |

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to set subscription"
Ensure you're logged in: `az login`

### "Log Analytics Workspace not found"
Verify the workspace name and resource group are correct.

### "Conflict detected"
Another diagnostic setting is already sending logs to the same workspace. Remove duplicate settings or use a different diagnostic setting name.

### Permission Errors
Ensure your account has **Monitoring Contributor** role on the resources.

## Resource Types Supported

- `Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostPools`
- `Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/applicationGroups`
- `Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/workspaces`

## Data Retention & Cost Considerations

### Log Analytics Retention
- **Default retention:** 30 days (free)
- **Extended retention:** Up to 730 days (additional cost applies)
- Configure retention in Log Analytics workspace settings
- Consider archive policies for long-term compliance needs

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. **Use allLogs category** - Simplifies configuration without missing critical data
2. **Set appropriate retention** - Balance compliance needs with storage costs
3. **Query efficiently** - Use time ranges and filters to minimize data processing
4. **Archive old data** - Move aged logs to cheaper storage tiers
5. **Monitor ingestion rates** - Track daily log volume in Log Analytics workspace

### Estimated Costs
Diagnostic logs for AVD typically generate:
- **Small environment** (< 50 users): ~1-2 GB/month
- **Medium environment** (50-200 users): ~5-10 GB/month
- **Large environment** (> 200 users): ~20+ GB/month

*Actual costs depend on user activity, connection frequency, and error rates.*
