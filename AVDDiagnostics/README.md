# AVD Diagnostics Configuration Tool

## Overview

This tool discovers AVD resources in your Azure subscription and configures diagnostic settings to send logs and metrics to a Log Analytics workspace. It enforces the use of `allLogs` category group wherever supported for comprehensive logging.

## Purpose

Azure Virtual Desktop generates diagnostic logs that are **critical for monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining a healthy AVD environment**. However, diagnostic settings are **not enabled by default** on AVD resources. This script automates the configuration process across all your AVD resources (Host Pools, Application Groups, and Workspaces), ensuring consistent logging coverage.

**Key Goals:**
- **Automate** diagnostic settings configuration across all AVD resources
- **Standardize** logging configuration using best practices (allLogs category)
- **Eliminate** manual configuration overhead and human error
- **Ensure** comprehensive visibility into your AVD environment

## What Are AVD Diagnostic Logs?

Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostic logs capture detailed telemetry about your AVD environment's operations, performance, and user activities. These logs are stored in Log Analytics workspaces where they can be queried, analyzed, and used for alerting.

### Critical Log Categories

| Resource Type | Log Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Host Pool | `HostRegistration` | Session host registration events and health status changes |
| Host Pool | `Connection` | User connection attempts, successes, and failures |
| Host Pool | `Error` | Errors occurring at the host pool level |
| Host Pool | `Checkpoint` | Lifecycle events and state transitions |
| Host Pool | `Management` | Administrative operations and configuration changes |
| Host Pool | `AgentHealthStatus` | AVD agent health monitoring |
| Application Group | `Checkpoint` | Application group lifecycle events |
| Application Group | `Error` | Application-specific errors |
| Application Group | `Management` | Application group configuration changes |
| Workspace | `Checkpoint` | Workspace lifecycle events |
| Workspace | `Error` | Workspace-level errors |
| Workspace | `Management` | Workspace configuration changes |
| Workspace | `Feed` | User feed subscription activities |

### Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario | Log Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Troubleshooting Connection Issues | `WVDConnections` | Identify failed user connections in the last 24 hours |
| Monitoring Agent Health | `WVDAgentHealthStatus` | Detect session hosts in a non-Available state |
| Tracking User Sessions | `WVDConnections` | Summarize active sessions per user over the last 7 days |

**Troubleshooting Connection Issues:**
```kusto
WVDConnections
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where State == "Failed"
| project TimeGenerated, UserName, ClientOS, ClientType, CorrelationId, Message
```

**Monitoring Agent Health:**
```kusto
WVDAgentHealthStatus
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where Status != "Available"
| summarize count() by SessionHostName, Status
```

**Tracking User Sessions:**
```kusto
WVDConnections
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where State == "Connected"
| summarize Sessions = count() by UserName, ClientOS
| order by Sessions desc
```

## Why Enable Diagnostic Logs? (Best Practices)

Enabling diagnostic logs for Azure Virtual Desktop is considered a **critical best practice** for the following reasons:

| Best Practice | Benefits |
|---------------|----------|
| **Proactive Monitoring & Alerting** | • Detect issues before users report them<br>• Create alerts for failed connections, agent health problems, or resource errors<br>• Monitor session host registration failures in real-time<br>• Track authentication and authorization failures |
| **Troubleshooting & Root Cause Analysis** | • Investigate user connection failures with detailed error codes<br>• Trace the complete user journey from connection attempt to session establishment<br>• Correlate events across Host Pools, Application Groups, and Workspaces<br>• Analyze patterns in failures to identify systemic issues |
| **Security & Compliance** | • Audit administrative changes to AVD resources<br>• Track user access patterns for security analysis<br>• Meet compliance requirements for logging and retention (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2)<br>• Detect anomalous connection patterns or potential security threats |
| **Performance Optimization** | • Identify resource bottlenecks and capacity issues<br>• Analyze connection latency and performance metrics<br>• Track session host utilization patterns<br>• Optimize scaling decisions based on historical data |
| **Capacity Planning** | • Understand usage trends over time<br>• Plan for growth based on connection patterns<br>• Right-size your AVD deployment<br>• Forecast infrastructure needs |
| **Cost Management** | • Track resource utilization to identify underutilized resources<br>• Correlate costs with usage patterns<br>• Optimize VM sizing and scaling policies |
| **Azure Monitor Integration** | • Build comprehensive dashboards with AVD metrics<br>• Integrate with Azure Monitor Workbooks for visualization<br>• Create automated remediation workflows<br>• Export data to SIEM systems for enterprise-wide monitoring |
| **Microsoft Support Requirements** | • Microsoft Support often requires diagnostic logs for troubleshooting<br>• Proactive logging accelerates support case resolution<br>• Historical data helps identify intermittent issues |
